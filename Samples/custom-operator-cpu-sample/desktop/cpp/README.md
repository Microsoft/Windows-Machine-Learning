# Custom Operator Sample

This is a desktop application that uses models containing custom operator definitions and implementations.
The necessary code is included to define and register these custom operators. API reference:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/custom-operators

## Included custom operators
There are three custom operators included in this sample: Relu, NoisyRelu and Debug.
The Relu custom operator is replacing an existing operator while NoisyRelu and Debug are new operators.

Relu transforms the input data using the function max(0, input). Noisy Relu is a variant of Relu which introduces Guassian noise.
For more information on these functions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)#Noisy_ReLUs

The Debug Operator is designed to help with debugging intermediate outputs.
There are two attributes required for this operator:
  1. file_type: [png|text] The format to export intermediate outputs.
		png will interpret and export intermediate output as an image and requires tensor data in NCHW format.
		text will output raw tensor data in human readable format
  2. file_path: The file path to export intermediate outputs. Note that the parent directory of this file must exist. 
		It is recommended for png debug operators consuming tensor data with many channels to output to its own directory since a png will be created for each channel.

The Relu and NoisyRelu operator client code curates its own input data, but the Debug operator client code accepts an input image and runs a modified SqueezeNet model.

## Adding Debug operator to your app
1. Compile debug_cpu.cpp and debug_cpu.h into your project.
2. Compile customoperatorprovider.h into your project but first remove non DebugOperatorFactory functions in the RegisterSchemas and RegisterKernels subroutines and remove the include statements for relu_cpu.h and noisyrelu_cpu.h.
3. When you initialize your LearningModel, pass in a custom provider like so:
```
 auto customOperatorProvider = winrt::make<CustomOperatorProvider>();
 auto provider = customOperatorProvider.as<ILearningModelOperatorProvider>();
 auto model = LearningModel::LoadFromFilePath(modelPath, provider);
```
4. Modify your input graph to include the Debug Operator as demonstrated in customize-model\debug_one_output.py

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2017 Version 15.7.4 or Newer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads)
- [Windows 10 - Build 17763 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso)
- [Windows SDK - Build 17763 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK)
- Visual Studio Extension for C++/WinRT

  Do the following to add the C++/WinRT extension in Visual Studio.
  1. Go to **Tools > Extensions and Updates**. 
  2. Select **Online** in the left pane and search for "WinRT" using the search box.
  3. Select the **C++/WinRT** extension, click **Download**, and close Visual Studio. The extension should install automatically.
  4. When the extension has finished installing, re-open Visual Studio.

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build.
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File > Open > Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the **Samples** subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample (**custom-operator-cpu-sample\desktop\cpp**). Double-click the Visual Studio solution file (.sln).
4. Confirm that the project is pointed to the correct SDK that you installed (e.g. 17763). You can do this by right-clicking the project in the **Solution Explorer**, selecting **Properties**, and modifying the **Windows SDK Version**.
5. Confirm that you are set for the right configuration and platform (for example: Debug, x64).
6. Build the solution (**Ctrl+Shift+B**).

## Run the sample

1. Open a Command Prompt (in the Windows 10 search bar, type **cmd** and press **Enter**).
2. Change the current folder to the folder containing the built EXE (`cd <path-to-exe>`).
3. Run the executable as shown below. Make sure to replace the install location with what matches yours:
  ```
  custom-operator-cpu-sample.exe debug <path to image file>
  custom-operator-cpu-sample.exe relu
  custom-operator-cpu-sample.exe noisyrelu
  ```
